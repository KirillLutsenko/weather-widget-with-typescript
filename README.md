**Tasks:** 

In this project, you need to implement an advanced weather widget.

List of functions that must be implemented:

- The application must be able to show the weather for 7 days in advance
- The weather forecast should display: day of the week, day and month, temperature, humidity level, chance of rain, and type of day (cloudy, sunny, it is rainy )
- By default, the weather for today is selected, but the user has the opportunity
switch day by clicking on another day at the bottom of the page
- The application should be able to filter the days according to the specified criteria. (Day type: cloudy or rainy, minimum temperature, maximum temperature)
- After applying the filter, the application displays only those days that meet the specified criteria
- If there are no days available according to the specified criteria, you need to display the text According to the specified criteria no days available
- To work with time, you need to use the moment library
- Application must use data from API
- Data persistence in this project needs to be implemented using Redux
- The application must be able to work with the API

**Note**

- Checkboxes in the filter work like radio buttons, in other words, the day can be or cloudy or sunny
- Filter input can only accept numbers
- The application shows the current day on the first day of the week
- If the filter is applied, the maximum number of days to view on the screen should be no more than 7
- If the current filter selected more than 7 days, then on the screen you need to display
next 7 days
- The filter does not show the weather for the previous days on the screen. All the days that have been earlier today are considered previous.
- The API server returns an array of days from which you need to filter the days that
needed by the user on the screen
- API documentation: https://lab.lectrum.io/rtx/docs/weather/
- You don't need to cover your app with tests
- The application, in terms of its functionality, should correspond as much as possible to the reference versions
- Reference version: https://lab.lectrum.io/weather
